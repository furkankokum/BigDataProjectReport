# BigDataProjectReport
This project analyzes internet censorship targeting communication apps like Signal, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Telegram using OONI measurement data. We developed a Spark-based pipeline to process large-scale JSONL files, identifying failure patterns such as DNS errors and TCP resets that indicate blocking. Results are stored in Parquet format and visualized through Elasticsearch. For visualization, we deployed a scalable Elasticsearch cluster on AWS EC2 using Docker, consisting of one master node with Kibana and three data nodes. We then used Spark to batch-load seven years of data (2019â€“2025) into the cluster. To ensure the dashboards remain up to date, we automated the data ingestion using Apache Airflow, which runs daily Spark DAGs at 04:00 UTC, shortly after the source data becomes available (typically by 02:00 UTC). This pipeline ensures that Elasticsearch and Kibana visualizations are continuously refreshed with minimal latency. Our findings reveal regional censorship trends and common blocking methods, contributing to a clearer understanding of global digital repression. 

NOTE: This project is not a graduation project.
